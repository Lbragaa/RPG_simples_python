Purpose: Core game systems (pure logic where possible).

Planned modules:
- combat.py: Turn order, damage, crits, status checks.
- leveling.py: XP thresholds and level-up choices.
- inventory.py: Equip/use items, consumables.
- encounters.py: Generate/select encounters from data.

No code yetâ€”these will be implemented incrementally.
