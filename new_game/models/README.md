Purpose: Domain models for the game.

Planned modules:
- stats.py: Base Stats dataclass (hp, atk, def, spd, etc.).
- character.py: Abstract base for Player/Enemy.
- player.py: Player-specific fields and methods.
- enemy.py: Enemy archetype with references to data definitions.
- item.py: Items (weapons, armor, consumables) and modifiers.
- effects.py: Buff/debuff/status effect definitions.

No code yetâ€”these files will be added as development proceeds.
